This is a regression problem. You have to predict "price".

You should split date into year and month columns. You can then optionally combine them into a numeric date column.

Split the data into train and test, using 0.9 for the ratio, and a seed of 123. That should give you 19,462 training rows and 2,151 test rows.

If you decide you want a valid data set, too, split that from train after doing the above split.

Your target is an RMSE below $123,000.
